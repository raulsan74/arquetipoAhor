# Ahorcado v1

Early but functional version of the popular hangman game written in Java. It runs on console and writes the progress of the players in plain text files.
It structure is based on this early UML:

## Installation

As is still in develpment, it has no .jar file nor executable. To try it, just clone the project and run it on console:

git clone https://github.com/Dinora15/arquetipoAhor.git


## Usage and features

The game is fully functional and displays the following features:

1. It has a premade list of players, but it could be made that you can use a completely new one:

2. You can save and load your game by writing on files (all arranged in the FileAhorcado class).

3. You can exit the game at any moment by typing 9 and exit ('Salir').

4. It shows graphicaly the hangman representation so you can see how close you are to losing the game.


## Contributing

Functional as it is, it can and should be still improved and upgraded. Some of the changes the development team has in mind 
include:

1. Multiplayer mode, so two or more players try to be the first getting the word right.
2. Playing as someone with a different name as those already included (just typing yor name).
3. Allowing new words to play with, aside from those in the list. It would improve replayability.
4. Change the save/load to a database based one instead of files. 


We'd be grateful if you create a new branch to try new implementations related (or not) to this project.
